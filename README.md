Hello! I'm Mariusz 🌍, originally from Poland 🇵🇱 and currently call Madrid home 🏠.

My professional journey has been quite a ride, transitioning from the coffee industry to pursuing a career in tech. Fueled by curiosity, I've been on this adventure for almost two years now.

I have learned quite a bit, but despite the progress made, the hunger for knowledge keeps me going.

I have built projects that reflect my interests and include:

* web scraping project for coffee enthusiasts [bean bazaar](https://www.thisisfaraday.com/)
* ai based app for Spanish language learners [hable mas](https://www.thisisfaraday.com/)
* learning planner for everyone [task ease](https://www.thisisfaraday.com/)

Every challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow. If you've navigated a similar path or have insights to share, I'd love to connect and share experiences.

* Read more about me in my [portfolio](https://www.mariuszgruszczynski.com/).
* If you find my profile interesting, please feel free to reach out. mario.gruszczynski@gmail.com

* PS Facing challenges as a self-taught developer in transition, I welcome connections. If you're in a similar position, let's connect!
