# Hello there 👋  
I'm **Mariusz**, a Front-End Developer with a love for thoughtful design, clean code, and strong coffee ☕️ 



### 🚀 What I Do

Currently focused on building modern, fast, and accessible products with **Vue**, **React**, and **TypeScript**. I care deeply about developer experience, performance, and the impact design has on usability.
I love working across the stack and enjoy tackling challenges from UI polish to backend logic and everything in between
