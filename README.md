Hello! I'm Mariusz 🌍, originally from Poland 🇵🇱 and currently calling Madrid home 🏠.

A self-taught developer in transition from the coffee industry to tech

My professional journey has been quite a ride, transitioning from the coffee industry to pursuing a career in tech. Fueled by curiosity, I've been on this self-taught tech adventure for almost two years now.

I have larean quite a bit, but despite the progress made, the hunger for knowledge keeps me going.

I have build applications reflect my interests and include:

* web scraping project for coffee enthusiasts [bean bazaar](https://www.thisisfaraday.com/)
* ai based app for Spanish languages lerners [hable mas](https://www.thisisfaraday.com/)
* learnig planner for all [task ease](https://www.thisisfaraday.com/)


As a self-taught developer, someone in transition from one career path to another every challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow. If you've navigated a similar path or have insights to share, I'd love to connect and exchange experiences.
