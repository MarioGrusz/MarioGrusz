# Hello there 👋  
I'm **Mariusz**, a Front-End Developer with a love for thoughtful design, clean code, and strong coffee ☕️ 

### 🧠 I belive that:

Tools are just tools. The product — and the people who use it — come first. 


### 🚀 What I Do

Currently focused on building modern, fast, and accessible products with **Vue**, **React**, and **TypeScript**. I care deeply about developer experience, performance, and the impact design has on usability.

I love working across the stack and enjoy tackling challenges from UI polish to backend logic and everything in between


### 💬 Let’s Talk

I'm actively looking for new opportunities to grow as a developer and contribute meaningfully to product teams.  

If you're working on something exciting, let’s connect and explore how I can help:
